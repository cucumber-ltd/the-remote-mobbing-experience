It was a dark and rainy day in Porto. Bob the rooster was walking across the double-decker bridge, looking down into the water from the top level. 

He frowned as he considered how on earth he could get rid of the blood stained knife now. Maria the Monkey sighed deeply, Bob was nervously twitching and waving his arms around. She worried he'd attract attention and the knife would be discovered. Last time this happened they had come so close to getting caught.

The police officer at the end of the bridge glanced in their direction. "It's Carvalho! Act normal", Maria mouthed under her breath and Bob nodded nonchalantly over in the officer's direction. 

Carvalho started to walk towards them, looking suspicious.  At the same time, the sound of a police siren could be heard approaching the other end of the bridge.

Maria looked down.  "Bob, you idiot! You're leaving a trail of bloody footprints behind us!  Didn't you learn anything from the last time?!  We need to get back to the boat before Carvalho catches up with us!"

Bob hissed "Forget the boat.  Let's make a run for the metro!" 

Suddenly it started to rain even harder and a storm is starting to brew.
